       "\"There are several factors that have contributed to Apple's strong performance compared to other tech companies in the last quarter. \\n\\n1. Diversified Revenue Streams: Apple has a diverse range of products and services, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and services such as Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple Pay. This diversification helps mitigate risks associated with relying on a single product or service for revenue.\\n\\n2. Strong iPhone Sales: Despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic, Apple has continued to see strong demand for its flagship product, the iPhone. The launch of the iPhone 12 series in the last quarter has been particularly successful, driving revenue growth.\\n\\n3. Services Revenue Growth: Apple's services segment, which includes subscriptions to Apple Music, iCloud, and the App Store, has been a key driver of revenue growth. The shift towards a subscription-based model has helped Apple generate recurring revenue streams and reduce its reliance on hardware sales.\\n\\n4. Strong Financial Position: Apple has a strong balance sheet with ample cash reserves, which provides the company with the flexibility to invest in research and development, acquisitions, and share buybacks. This financial strength has helped Apple weather economic uncertainties and continue to innovate.\\n\\n5. Innovation and Brand Loyalty: Apple has a track record of innovation, with a strong focus on product design and user experience.

       "'The recent Supreme Court ruling on intellectual property rights has significant implications for creators, innovators, and businesses. Intellectual property rights refer to the legal protections granted to individuals or organizations for their creations or inventions, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court ruling may have clarified or expanded the scope of intellectual property rights, providing more protection for creators and innovators. This could lead to increased incentives for individuals and businesses to invest in research and development, knowing that their intellectual property will be safeguarded.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the ruling may also have limitations or restrictions on intellectual property rights, potentially impacting the ability of creators to fully protect their creations. This could have negative consequences for innovation and creativity, as individuals may be less inclined to invest in developing new ideas if they are not adequately protected.\\n\\nOverall, the implications of the Supreme Court ruling on intellectual property rights will depend on the specific details of the case and how it is interpreted and applied in future legal proceedings. It is important for individuals and businesses to stay informed about changes in intellectual property law and seek legal advice to ensure their rights are protected.'"

       "'Teaching critical thinking skills in the classroom is essential for preparing students to think analytically, solve problems, and make informed decisions. Here are some best practices for teaching critical thinking skills:\\n\\n1. Encourage questioning: Encourage students to ask questions and challenge assumptions. Create a classroom environment where students feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and opinions.\\n\\n2. Provide opportunities for discussion: Engage students in discussions that require them to analyze and evaluate different perspectives. Encourage them to support their arguments with evidence and reasoning.\\n\\n3. Teach problem-solving strategies: Teach students how to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. Encourage them to consider multiple solutions and evaluate the pros and cons of each.\\n\\n4. Use real-world examples: Use real-world examples to illustrate the importance of critical thinking skills in everyday life. Encourage students to apply critical thinking skills to analyze current events, scientific discoveries, or historical events.\\n\\n5. Incorporate collaborative learning: Encourage students to work together in groups to solve problems and discuss ideas. Collaborative learning can help students develop their critical thinking skills by engaging in meaningful discussions and debates.\\n\\n6. Provide feedback: Provide constructive feedback to students on their critical thinking skills. Encourage them to reflect on their thought processes and consider how they can improve their analytical skills.\\n\\n7. Use multimedia resources: Incorporate multimedia resources such as videos, podcasts, and interactive simulations to engage students in critical thinking activities. These resources can help students develop their analytical skills in a more interactive and engaging way.\\n\\nOverall, teaching critical thinking skills in the classroom requires a combination of encouraging questioning, providing opportunities for discussion, teaching problem-solving strategies, using real-world examples, incorporating collaborative learning, providing feedback, and using multimedia resources. By implementing these best practices, educators can help students develop the critical thinking skills necessary for success in academics and beyond.'"

    "1. Financial Analysts Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question: Why is Apple outperforming the tech sector in the past quarter?\n",

    "In this setup, the MultiPromptChain routes each question to the correct domain based on its content. It uses a LLMRouterChain to match the question to a specialized domain (Financial Analysts, Lawyers, Educators). If no domain fits, the default_chain handles the question.\n",

    "This architecture can be extended to handle more domains and even complex routing logic based on more nuanced inputs."
