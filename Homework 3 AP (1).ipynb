    "**Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to practice data cleaning using Python and Pandas. You will work with a real-world dataset to identify and handle common data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most tragic and well-known maritime disasters. While luck played a role in survival, data suggests that factors like age, gender, and socio-economic status significantly influenced a passenger's chances of survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we aim to explore the question: \"What kinds of people were more likely to survive?\" To do this, we will first focus on cleaning the Titanic passenger dataset, which includes features such as name, age, gender, and class, preparing it for further analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "1. Remove any duplicate entries in the dataset. The PassengerId column can be used as a unique identifier for each passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Backfill missing values in the Age column using the median of the existing ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a scatter plot with the Fare on the x-axis and Age on the y-axis. This will help you visualize the relationship between passenger fare and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate and display the survival rate for each passenger class (Pclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate and display the survival rate for each gender."

    "Creating a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between passenger fare and age allows us to identify potential trends and patterns within the data. By plotting Fare on the x-axis and Age on the y-axis, we can explore how these two variables interact, revealing insights into the demographics of passengers who paid different fare amounts. This visualization aids in understanding the influence of age on ticket pricing and survival outcomes, facilitating a deeper analysis of the dataset."

    "#### Code Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Importing Matplotlib:** The code starts by importing the matplotlib.pyplot module as plt, which is a widely used library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Creating a Figure:** The line plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) initializes a new figure for the plot with a specified size of 10 inches wide by 6 inches tall. This ensures that the scatter plot is adequately sized for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Creating the Scatter Plot:** The command plt.scatter(df_cleaned['Fare'], df_cleaned['Age'], alpha=0.5) generates the scatter plot with Fare plotted on the x-axis and Age on the y-axis. The alpha=0.5 parameter adds transparency to the points, helping to mitigate overlap and improve visibility in areas with many data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adding Titles and Labels:**\n",
    "\n",
    "       * plt.title('Scatter Plot of Fare vs. Age', fontsize=16): This sets the title of the plot, which provides context for the      visualization.\n",
    "       * plt.xlabel('Fare', fontsize=14): This labels the x-axis as \"Fare,\" indicating what data is represented.\n",
    "       * plt.ylabel('Age', fontsize=14): This labels the y-axis as \"Age,\" clarifying the variable plotted.\n",
    "       * Displaying the Plot: Finally, the command plt.show() renders the scatter plot on the screen, allowing for visual analysis of the relationship between fare and age among the passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization is an important step in exploring data relationships, helping to identify trends and patterns that may inform further analysis."

    "## I. Analyzing Survival Rate: Insights into Passenger Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the survival rate among passengers is crucial for understanding the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster. By examining the proportion of survivors compared to the total number of passengers, we can gain valuable insights into demographic trends and characteristics associated with higher survival rates. This analysis serves as a foundation for further exploration into the impacts of variables such as age, gender, and class on survival outcomes."
